			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Event Planner Ltd is an event logistics and marketing company which was formed back in 2013.
               Our company offers A-Z event planning services by a team of experienced and energetic event
               planners, suppliers, venues and more. One of the main reasons behind the success of Event 
               Planner Ltd is the fact that<strong> we do not charge our clients fees! </strong>
               Due to the numerous events that we organize, Event Planner Ltd does not need to add exorbitant fees and mark-ups to make 
               profit margins. This ensures that our clients list, which is constantly growing, make regular use of
               our services.</p>
